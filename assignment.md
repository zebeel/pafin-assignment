# Tech Assignment - Backend Data Handling v3

## Objective:

The objective of this assignment is to evaluate your skills in handling data on the backend using Node.JS and PostgreSQL.

## Requirements:

You are required to develop a RESTful API that allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete data on a PostgreSQL database. The API should be developed using Typescript and Node.JS, and should conform to the following specifications:

1. The API should support CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations for a single resource - User.
   - A User resource should have the following attributes:
     - id: unique identifier for the user (string or UUID)
     - name: user's name (string)
     - email: user's email address (string)
     - password: user's password (string)
2. The API should handle input validation and provide appropriate error messages for invalid inputs.
3. The API should be secured using JWT authentication.
4. The API should be well documented with clear instructions on how to run the code and test the API.

## Additional Information:

1. You can use any Node.JS and PostgreSQL libraries that you deem necessary.
2. You must configure Docker containers for both Node.JS and PostgreSQL including configuration files.
3. You can use any tool or framework that you are comfortable with for testing the API.
4. You are encouraged to write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
5. Your application should run and be testable with simple CLI commands.

## Deliverables:

1. A GitHub repository with all the code required to run the API.
2. A README file with clear instructions on how to run the code and test the API.
3. You should be able to answer any questions regarding design and implementation decisions.

## Estimated Time:

This assignment should take on average about 1 day to complete.
